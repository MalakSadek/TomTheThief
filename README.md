# Tom The Thief
A 2D Maze-Based Video Game ðŸŽ® ðŸ’» (2015)

The game is coded in `C++` and begins with an introductory comic strip and the main menu also allows the user to alter various settings. The start of the game is in a hub, featuring a mini-map, that allows the user to select the level they want to play, the actual game is a maze that is hidden from the user, except for a field of view around the character. The user must collect coins and a key to open the door and escape the level, however enemies begin chasing the character once they reach a certain threshold distance from them and will follow the character using `Djiksta's shortest path algorithm`. The levels progress in difficulty. The graphics are implemented using `SFML`, `2D Sprite Sheets` are used for animated components, and the worlds were created using `Tiled`.
